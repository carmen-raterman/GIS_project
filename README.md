# Spatial Analysis of 1894 Cholera Outbreak in Soho

## Project Description

This project analyzes cholera case data from 1894 London, focusing on the Soho neighborhood. The analysis includes data wrangling, spatial analysis, and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify areas with high densities of cholera cases. The goal is to understand the spread of the disease and provide recommendations for interventions and policy improvements.

## Library Setup

The following libraries are used in this project:

- `tidyverse`: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- `rio`: For reading various data formats, including Excel and SAS.
- `sf`: For reading and handling spatial data.
- `tmap`: For creating maps.
- `SpatialKDE`: For KDE analysis.

## Usage

To reproduce this analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure the `lab_data` folder is in the same directory as the R Markdown file.
3. Install the required libraries: "tidyverse", "rio", "sf", "tmap", "SpatialKDE"
4. Open the R Markdown file and knit it to generate the report.

Feel free to explore the code and data, and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
